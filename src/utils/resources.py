MAP_CARD_CAPTION = (
    "Note: The map shows that the absolute number of disasters is highest in densely populated "
    "countries such as China, India and the USA. However, if we consider density in relation to "
    "surface area, we can see that many small countries are actually very affected in proportion "
    "to their size, such as the Philippines and Haiti. A country's vulnerability therefore depends "
    "not only on its exposure to hazards, but also on its ability to cope with them."
)

TEMPORAL_CARD_CAPTION = (
    "Note: In recent years, there has been a slight downward trend in the total number of disasters "
    "recorded, although their human impact remains highly variable depending on the event. This "
    "visualization shows that the impact of disasters strongly depends on the local context: developed "
    "countries suffer greater economic losses, while developing countries record more victims, reflecting "
    "global disparities in disaster resilience."

TREEMAP_CARD_CAPTION = (
    "Note: The treemap reveals specific geographical vulnerabilities: China and the Philippines are "
    "particularly hard hit by floods, Japan and Indonesia by earthquakes, while the USA is more affected "
    "by storms. These differences reflect the specific vulnerabilities linked to each country's context: "
    "level of industrialization, healthcare system, or exposure to meteorological phenomena."
)

DETAILS_CARD_CAPTION = (
    "Note: Exploring the data country by country, we discover very different profiles: the USA is mainly "
    "affected by storms and tornadoes, China records a high number of industrial accidents, while countries "
    "like Niger face recurrent epidemics."
)

PIE_CARD_CAPTION = (
    "Note: Although floods and storms are the most frequent disasters, earthquakes cause the most deaths. "
    "This difference can be explained by the sudden and unpredictable nature of earthquakes, making evacuation "
    "impossible, unlike floods and storms, which can often be anticipated thanks to weather forecasting systems."
)

TABLE_CARD_CAPTION = (
    "Note: The deadliest disasters are mainly earthquakes, floods, and storms, which cause the most deaths "
    "notably in 2010 with the devastating earthquake in Haiti. This table allows us to identify the most vulnerable "
    "regions and the types of disasters that have the greatest impact on human life."
